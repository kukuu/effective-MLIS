## Management Styles

Different types of leadership styles exist in work environments. The culture and goals of an organization determine which leadership style fits the firm best, while personality differences often dictate which is most often used. Some companies offer several leadership styles within the organization, dependent upon the necessary tasks to complete and departmental needs.

### The Laissez-Faire Leader

A laissez-faire leader lacks direct supervision of employees and fails to provide regular feedback to those under his supervision.

### The Autocrat

The autocratic leadership style allows managers to make decisions alone without the input of others. This leadership style benefits employees who require close supervision. Creative employees who thrive in group functions detest this leadership style.

### The Participative Leader

Often called the democratic leadership style, participative leadership values the input of team members and peers, but the responsibility of making the final decision rests with the participative leader.

Participative leadership boosts employee morale because employees make contributions to the decision-making process. It causes them to feel as if their opinions matter.

### The Transactional Leader

Managers using the transactional leadership style receive certain tasks to perform and provide rewards or punishments to team members based on performance results. Managers and team members set predetermined goals together, and employees agree to follow the direction and leadership of the manager to accomplish those goals. The manager possesses power to review results and train or correct employees when team members fail to meet goals. Employees receive rewards, such as bonuses, when they accomplish goals.

### The Transformational Leader

The transformational leadership style depends on high levels of communication from management to meet goals. Leaders motivate employees and enhance productivity and efficiency through communication and high visibility and empowerment. This style of leadership requires the involvement of management to meet goals. Leaders focus on the big picture within an organization and delegate smaller tasks to the team to accomplish goals.

## Continuous Delivery (RRASc)

Reliable :: Repeatable :: Automation :: Source control
CD is the ability to get changes of all types including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.

A logical extension of Continuous Integration, It is based on the use of smart automation. This is all about creating a repeatable and reliable process for delivering software. You have to automate pretty much everything in order to be able to achieve continuous delivery. Manual steps will get in the way or become a bottleneck. This goes for everything from requirements authoring to deploying to production.

The ultimate goal of continuous delivery is to minimise the iteration time of the code-test-deliver-measure experimentation cycle. Increasing deliverable throughput in this way is the key to not only more feature work being delivered but higher quality code as well. This might seem counter-intuitive at first but code is fixed and polished through that same cycle and less time spent on deployment is more time spent on designing quality code. - https://github.com/kukuu/AGILITY


## How to motivate your team

Teams are the way that most companies get important work done. When you combine the energy, knowledge, and skills of a motivated group of people, then you and your team can accomplish anything you set your minds to.

Hi-lighted below are some mistakes leaders make that drive away their top talent. Rule of thumb, "Reflect on your behavior, fix these mistakes, and get ready to boost your team performance and motivation."
1. Pay your people what they are worth

When you set your employees' salaries, be sure that their pay is consistent with what other companies in your industry and geographic area are paying. Remember: 26 percent of engaged employees say that they would leave their current job for just a 5 percent increase in pay. Don't lose great people because you're underpaying them.

2. Provide them with a pleasant place to work

Everyone wants to work in an office environment that is clean and stimulating, and that makes them feel good instead of bad. You don't have to spend a lot of money to make an office a more pleasant place to be.

3. Offer opportunities for self-development

The members of your team will be more valuable to your organization, and to themselves, when they have opportunities to learn new skills. Provide your team with the training they need to advance in their careers and to become knowledgeable about the latest technologies and industry news.

4. Foster collaboration within the team

Encourage the members of your team to fully participate by inviting their input and suggestions on how to do things better. Ask questions, listen to their answers, and, whenever possible, implement their solutions. Ensure retrospectives are continuously engaged.

5. Encourage happiness

Happy employees are enthusiastic and positive members of the team, and their attitude is infectious. Keep an eye on whether or not your people are happy with their work, their employer, and you. If they're not, you can count on this unhappiness to spread.

4. Don't punish failure

We all make mistakes. It's part of being human. The key is to learn valuable lessons from those mistakes so we don't make them again. When members of your team make honest mistakes, don't punish them--instead, encourage them to try again. Note the principle of fail fast in Agile.

5. Set clear goals

Sizeable amount of Employees have reported that they wasted time at work because they weren't aware of what work was a priority, and what wasn't. As a leader, it's your job to work with the members of your team to set clear goals. And once you do that, make sure everyone knows exactly what those goals are, what their relative priority is, and what the team's role is in reaching them.

6. Don't micromanage

No one likes a boss who is constantly looking over her shoulder and second-guessing her every decision. Sizeable percent of employees have reported that they would rather take on unpleasant activities than sit next to a micromanaging boss. Provide your people with clear goals, and then let them figure out the best way to achieve them.

7. Avoid useless meetings

Meetings can be an incredible waste of time--the average professional wastes 3.8 hours in unproductive meetings each and every week. Create an agenda for your meetings and distribute it in advance. Invite only the people who really need to attend, start the meeting on time, and then end it as quickly as you possibly can.

## Factors of Successful Teams: The Keys to Ensure High Team Performance

1. Domain Knowledge


2. Cohesiveness -  The first factor to consider is how cohesive members are with one another.

Once a team is highly cohesive, a member’s commitment and willingness to strive for excellence thrives. Team cohesion affects the extent to which members like one another, get along with each other, and trust and respect one another’s abilities and opinions.

Although these characteristics are difficult to observe, managers can look for signs that team members are well-acquainted past superficial meet-and-greet topics. Managers can also determine whether team members equally participate in group discussions and activities rather than forming cliques or subgroups of cohesive units.

3. Communication -  Efficient communication mechanisms are crucial to develop effective teams.

4. Groupthink -  This is when a group in a team tend to suppress the thinking and development of others.

Other signs of groupthink include individual conformity, apathy toward team goals and outcomes, peer-pressure exerted by leaders within the team, and discussions that tend to be one-sided.

5. Homogeneity -  Having the right ballanced composed members in the team.

It is the extent to which members are similar or different to one another. The difficulty for most project managers is finding the right balance between overly homogenous and overly heterogeneous teams. When evaluating team homogeneity, a manager can consider similarities and differences in personal characteristics, education, skills, abilities, generational backgrounds, cultural background, and income levels.

6. Role Identity -  Role identity is the extent to which members are capable of assuming different roles throughout the team structure, thus diversifying efforts and developing subject matter experts. Delegating by having experts in different disciplines . Empowerment.

7. Stability -  Teams that have higher turnover rates experience higher levels of group cohesion, better communication methods, and more effective role identity.

8. Team Size - By evaluating a team’s size, managers are able to maximize productivity to ensure high levels of team performance. The greater number of members within a team the more resources available to achieve a goal. However, as team size increases, so does the number of conflicts resulting in decreased levels of cohesion and inefficient productivity. To evaluate whether a team is too large or small, managers must consider how effectively and harmoniously members work together and whether the required tasks are being efficiently accomplished by all members of the team.
